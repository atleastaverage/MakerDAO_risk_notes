Steven Becker - Two items:
1. Metrics that we are looking at that may inform a change to the stability fee, was the first change impactful?
2. Let's revisit the whole idea on how to be a risk team. Let's use this space to determine what is necessary to act as a risk team.
3. Address questions and considerations that have been put toward us, Rich has these.

Steven: Let's jump off on the stability fee: 
1. We didn't see much effect on inventory levels.
2. We have seen a "kick up" in the Eth price.
3. Is there a determination between the prices and the fact that we've got a large provision of DAI that hasn't decreased at the moment.

Question: Since the Stability fee raise, do you think there has been an effect on the exchange rate?

Joe Quintilian: I don't think there has been much effect, just a little bit.

Chris Smith: My impression is that things have gotten worse now.

Question: With regard to the debt ceiling, how hard coded is that, is it possible to reduce that?

Joe Quintilian: That's actually a good question, we need to learn to use interest rates for the stability of the system.

David Hoffman: If we're talking about the DAI balancing around $1 as a function of the market cap of Ether, aren't we suggesting changing the stability fee any time the price of Ether changes to any significant degree?

Joe Q: Yeah, absolutely, that's how this has always been explained. We're always going to have to reactively adjust the stability fee and later the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) continuously, every single week.

Lev Livnev describes data:

Large CDP liquidated: https://mkr.tools/cdp/4492

A plot, the dots are individual trades, the size is proportional to the size of the trades. This was collected from the distributed exchanges (DEX's) where the most volume happens, Oasis, paradex, radar relay, etc. starting from 50 days ago. To get an implied DAI-to-USD value is I scaled the value of every trade which is on an Eth-to-DAI market with the coinbase Eth-USD price to get an implied valuation of the DAI. This is more interesting because it's rescaled by price to see what it's saying about the price of DAI to help us look for patterns. You can see pretty clearly why we've had these discussions the past few weeks. ... You see a lot of dispersion because it aggregates a lot of order books, and large bursts of trading have a large impact on order books. You can see an extreme example of that today because a large CDP got liquidated, and those liquidators are looking to get the DAI. That was huge volume because that was a huge CDP. (Probably referencing https://mkr.tools/cdp/4492)

Joe Q: A 0.5% raise really has no effect whatsoever. 

Rune: Is the reason because the change was too incremental, or was it not larger psychological to make people think...

Joe Q: Market dynamics drive changes at such a stronger degree than a stability fee, a lot of people open CDP's for fun without even looking at the stability fee. A 0.5% adjustment is meaningless.

Lev: Market sentiment and credit demand is sensitive to what's going on in the market. Indeed, what we've seen is possibly increased bullishness around ETH/USD. We saw remarkably few liquidations.

Lev: What's going on in the rest of defi is pretty relevant. Stuff like compound.finance. They're offering 2.25% interest on DAI. This must have some effect on the demand of DAI. Right now it's a viable strategy to mint DAI and lend it to compound for 2.25%. Those rates have an effect on the demand of DAI. The DAI rate on compound was recently 6% or 8%. 

Rune: That's becoming more popular in the DeFi space. The shift from using eth as a collatoralization method in order to acquire DAI, but there are lending markets looking for DAI. We're actually feeding into compund, nuo, uniswap. One of the major driver for DAI inventory is people lending from other platforms.

Vishesh's doc: http://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPP4diR1NNEZHZuypS3Zo5F8fqfvpq2yWLBFLSxvYWAhg & https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A6qShbHuRRo3oV_jaX4fhXELViawP28R1FQvp6kImos/edit

Vivesh: I pulled from some of the DEX's what the ETH/DAI trades were, the ETH/USD price pairs from coibase and created a DAI implied VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) over time. In the google doc the first two docs are cut up by the exchange sources, the second are combined together. After that, "What's the DAI price for DAI/USDC", what the implied DAI price would be going through USDC, the last is tradeblock.

Joe Q: A 0.5% stability fee doesn't work. I think the right thing to do is get consensus to get a 0.5% stability fee increase and set the expectation that if we once again see absolutely 0% effect and see a continuous negative trend, then we go back to 2% adjustment. We could have a discussion about that on Reddit. A "death spiral" happens at a certain point, you get less and less DAI demand as it gets cheaper because people think it's a terrible stablecoin. For now, let's just see if anyone disagrees with a 0.5% stability fee increase. 

Rune: Let's pass this to Steven, is it important that we maintain a certain cadence? There are market forces we don't understand and crypto forces no one understands. Is there a standard for the increase?

---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKDpN1fe0cU&t=1256s

Steven: The standard is generally linear. If you start at 0.5 and increase by 0.5 it's a 100% increase. If you increase by 0.5 again it's a 33% increase, and you want to keep it a consistant percentage. One thing that Lev brought up is, outside of the demand function is the DeFi space, and actually use the DeFi space to our advantage. I think we need to agree right now, that if we don't see an impact from the change in the stability fee, we need to agree what could be the influence. Perhaps the increase in the price of Eth could have caused people to draw more DAI.

We're dealing with a stability fee that tries to dis-incentivize people through the idea of cost. If that's not having an impact there's a possibility we need to increase that. Let's look at the DeFi space and see what's driving supply and demand. I get that this stability fee isn't working, we would have expected some kind of response and we're not getting one, so I think we need to increasing this in a linear fashion and then some sort of exponential fashion.

Rune: Are you saying we need to get a clearer picture of how people are using DAI?

Steven: I'm saying the one critical piece is understanding what the demand function is and improving it. We're trying to dis-incentivize people through cost, and if we see that's not having an impact we need to increase it more on a percentage basis. Let's look at the DeFi space, let's see what's driving the supply and demand, and how do we respond to that? The stability fee is not effective.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKDpN1fe0cU&t=1530s

Joe Q: I think we can definitely sign off on a 0.5% increase today. We've seen there's a bunch of evidence to increase the stability fee, let's see if there's any evidence that says don't increase it.

Steven: We generally use governance polling to get a consensus, I want everyone to understand that, what we're doing now substitutes that. We've laid down a premise that we're doing governance polling, and we need to recognize that we are to some extent going against what we've laid down in general. Would it make sense to open a governance pool for a couple of days?

Joe Q: What we're doing now is emulating the DSR adjstment process. I think it's time to split up short term Dai stabilization monetary policy and long-term risk governance and collateral onboarding decision making. Steven is saying we're having an executive vote, which isn't something we want to do like this in a long run, but a governance poll also isn't the idea because it's a very frequent event.

*Clarifying the governance process for increasing the Stability Fee without polling the community.

Joe Q: Rate changes will have to happen frequently. We should at least do a ceremonial pause to see if anyone wants to argue for the opposing point of view.

Steven: Does anyone disagree with this construct? We have 33 people online and I think this is a good sample of the broader community. Let's give it ten seconds for any disagreements.

Rune: I have a lot of strong opinions about rough consensus. This is one of the primary venues to share ideas, but not that we present ideas and come to a conclusion without the community.

Joe Q: If we have no information against a 0.5% increase then I think it's okay for us to go and do it.

Chris Burniske: I don't have a disagreement, but about 50 basis points, I want to be sure that we appear rational and not erratic to the community. Steven just gave the example that a 50 basis point increase would be a 50% increase, which is less than the last increase. We have and Ether rally, and we have the DeFi space that are both generating demand and creating a DAI supply glut. I don't see Eth rallying after the fork. For me, that would argue for a 50 basis point increase.

Rune: We need to decide 50 or 100 basis points, and we need to determine the cadence of these changes.

Joe Q: I don't think we can do a one percent increase today. There would have been no warning. Theoretically we could do a 0.5% increase because that's consistent with expectations. Then we can discuss how we can be more effective at the next couple of meetings.

Steven: I agree with this. We will go ahead with the proposal. To Rune's point, this is more about signaling and sticking to what you said. We can lay the foundation for increasing the stability fee by greater amounts in the future.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKDpN1fe0cU&t=2190s

Steven: I'm going to put forward a proposal to increase the stability fee by 0.5%, 50 basis points.

Lev: I would discourage thinking about fee changes in terms of "doubling" and "halving". These quantities don't have an absolute zero and that's not how quantities work.

Rune: Would it help us with signaling and messaging to talk to the community about our cadence for increasing the fee?

Steven: There are so many confounding variables. We could keep increasing the stability fee, but the external variables may change all of our assumptions.

Rune: I feel like we've reached rough consensus, but I feel like we're working with a hand tied behind our back. 

---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKDpN1fe0cU&t=2410s

Rune: Is there a possibility that there's just not enough room on the stability fee to see the kind of changes we want to see on inventory?

Steven: Yes.

Joe Q: That's only possible the other way. This is only a problem if we reach 0% and we want to go lower.

Rune: The risk I'm thinking of is that we raise the stability fee to the point that we price ourselves out of the ecosystem and we're no longer competitive.

Steven: We want to slow momentum as opposed to just turning off the lights.

Matthew: Is there a throttling method?

Lev: The stability fee is that throttle. The stability fee should come up to meet the credit demand with the DAI demand.

---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKDpN1fe0cU&t=2567s

Matthew: Is it possible to throttle the DAI issuance to something like 100,000 DAI a day? If the price of Eth spikes tomorrow there are people who will borrow against their ether to pay off their house. The price will go crazy against the peg because people won't be borrowing against DAI, they'll be taking the other direction.

Lev: Don't you think the throttle mechanism is a sharp cliff? For the first 100k issuance we'll have a nominal fee, then it becomes prohibitively high until tomorrow? Can you explain why the cliff is justified? We can probably pick a stability fee, 5%, 20% to balance against the demand.

Matthew: At that point you're going to price yourself out of the market.

Joe Q: We have a "Defensive Debt Ceiling" - we never want to keep an empty space of unused debt ceiling. If someone wanted to create a billion DAI they couldn't do it. We also have the Practical Debt ceiling managed by the Governance and Risk committee. Normal people shouldn't run into these limits.

Joe Q Suggests splitting the meetings into short-term governance and long-term governance meetings on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Wednesdays should be reserved for being actionable on the DAI peg.

Steven: Can we take this particular meeting and apportion it to two parts rather than holding two separate meetings? This will be less burdensome on calendars.

Joe Q: I'm open to either way.

Rune: Why don't we ask people to signal here in the chat.

Chris Burniske: It makes more sense to augment the current meeting into two thirty minute segments.

Joe Q: Right now we haven't even started with the actual risk/governance. Once we do roll out the risk parameters we're going to need an hour. We can have a hybrid for now, but we're going to need more when we do risk.

Rune: This sounds like a good place to stop. People can expect to see another proposal for 50 basis points. Steven, what do you think a good timeline would be?

Steven: Tuesday (February 26, 2019) is my first soft target, but hopefully BY Tuesday I'll have that out.
